Yes, it is I, says me
And all who agree are more than three cause theyre we, haha
Yes, yo, Im in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them?
But lets take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this path called

Stranded on death row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recites kinda lethal
Niggas know the flow that I kick, theres no equal
Im murderin niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone I kicks
When I grip the mic and kick shit niggas cant fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
Nough respect like a sensei, whoop ass like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin
Why dont you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson?
Take a walk through the hood where we up to no good
Slangin them things like a real O.G. should
Im stackin and mackin and packin a ten so
When youre slippin, I slip the clip in, but aint no set trippin
Cause its Death Row, rollin like the mafia
Think about whoopin some ass, but what the fuck stoppin ya?
Aint nothin but a buster
Im stranded on death row for pumpin slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know youre outdone, feel the shotgun
Kurupt, inmate, cell block one

No prevention from this lynchin of sorts
Youre a victim from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, its time you learn braille
From a lunatic, Im death like arsenic
When I kick a wicked rap, Dr. Dre will hit the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it many storms
When Im vexed, I fight leg, necks, and arms
In this dimension, Im the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the Hillside Strangler
Emcee mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do?
The narrator RBX, cell block two

Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded on death row and now Im servin a
Lifetime sentence, therell be no repentance
Since its the life that I choose to lead, I plead guilty
On all counts, let the ball bounce where it may
Its just another clip into my AK
Buck em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame, theres another dead, bang
Laying lame, put to shame, whos to blame?
Me, the Lady of Rage, a woman comin
From the D-E-A-T-H and R-O-W, takin no shit
So flip and youre bound to get dropped
Its 1-8-7 on motherfuckers, dont stop
Handcuffed as I bust, therell be no debate
Its Rage, from cell block H

Ayo, steppin through the fog and creepin through the smog
Its the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin raps for my snaps, now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homie, little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hands on the trigga
Shootin at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row cause I wanted to make a grip from servin my rocks
And Im still serving for mine
Peace to my motherfuckin homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin with your blues on, mad as hell
And youre sayin, Fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And its driving the cops crazy
But aint nothin but a black thing, baby
Uh, Im not flaggin, but Im just saggin
I betcha dont wanna see the D-O-double-G
And you cant see the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin homie D.O.C
You know you cant fuck with my motherfuckin DJ
Thats my homie and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you dont stop
Doggy Dogg break em down with the motherfuckin Dogg Pound
Thats the only way well beat em, man
We gotta smoke em then choke em like the motherfuckin Peterman
Its like three and to the two and two and to the one
Cell block four, peace, Doggy Doggs done

Yo, now you know the path Im on
You think youre strong?
See if you can travel on
Cause only the weak will try to speak
Those who are quiet will always cause riots
Theres three types of people in the world
Those who dont know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that make things happen
