You cant talk with a gun in your mouth? (It wasnt me!)
Listen up, nigga, you know Lucifer? (Nah)
Well, youre about to meet him, motherfucker

Whos the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin gun

Forty-four reasons come to mind
Why a motherfuckin brother is hard to find
He been walking on the streets and fuckin with mine
Stupid punk cant fuck with a mastermind
See, I never take a step on a Compton block
Or L.A. without the AK ready to pop
Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Aint the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I think its better to be tellin the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
Goddamn! Cause its the city
And for you to survive, a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And Im a nigga you cant remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin to prove
To they homies that they can hang by dealin with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
Cause I relax, sit back, do a job and jet
Yo, I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

Whos the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin gun
Whos the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin gun

D-R-E, a motherfucker whos known for carrying gats
And kick raps that make snaps, adapts to
Any environment that Im located at
If you see me on the solo move believe that Im strapped
Four-four, tray-eight or AK-47
Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it dont stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

I breaks em off, I breaks em off, yeah
I breaks em off, I breaks em off, yeah

I breaks em off, but I aint speaking about between the thighs
Im talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes
Itll make you drop to your knees cause you realize
That a gatll make any nigga civilized
Old buster-ass nigga talking bullshit
Dont know that Im the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks em off properly
Real G so dont doubt it
Im the one whos doin it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my forty-four Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name is Dre Eastwood when Im packing a gun
You dont believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die, yous a buster, cause real niggas dont die
But some still dont hear me, though
Youre too near me not to hear me, nigga, yo
So now you know
