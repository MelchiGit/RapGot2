Yeah, I mean, I listen to these rap records
Half the time Im suspicious
You niggas sound so fictitious
Believe me, I know the difference
I got some words for you niggas
Youre the definition of (satisfiction)
Listen up, I been where you goin three times and plus
Big houses, cars, jewelry, bad bitches all around this motherfucker, uh
I seen it all and guess what?
Its the (Satisfiction), you feel me?

Oh yeah, oh I see what you sayin
I know some niggas just like that
Frontin ass niggas, man, really aint got no bucks like that
Stuck like that, its cool if you cool with gettin love like that
Flashin down to Southside Raleigh
Youll be runnin outta luck like that
What I mean by that is why your name always in these rental records?
Spendin rent money gettin that bottle service into your section
You leased your car, leased your house, leased your spouse
Know she leavin if you run outta paper
And might be smashin your neighbor
I know you think you a star cause followers clickin
Guess your ambition is to keep up with social tradition
Like sneaker shoppin some of you niggas is fuckin sickenin
Cause youll take your soul out, just so you could fit in

These labels always askin me to do a song with these niggas
Doc, I think its time for you to open up the pharmacy, nigga

Nah, Ive been doin me lokin, keepin these bad bitches open
And keepin em wet, yep, see cause Long Beach right by that ocean
Still sippin that gin and juice, my nigga, yep Im still on that potion
And all these random niggas fake as fuck and Im still gettin noticed
God damn, man, how we sposed to handle this shit, cuh
Everything we built these niggas done dismantled this shit, cuh
We gotta get back to that real, thats on the dub
Another lesson from your uncle Snoop, what, what, what?

Im just statin the facts
Dont get no realer than that
Satisfiction, attention, listen, play your position, player
Shouldnt be too hard, my nigga
Its supposed to be like a lay up
Shouldnt be so hard to be yourself
My nigga, wake up
Stay up, pay up, straight up, cake up
Thats what Im made of, high? Yup
My life is all authentic, thats why Im goin way up
Your satisfaction fictitious, your happiness is made up
