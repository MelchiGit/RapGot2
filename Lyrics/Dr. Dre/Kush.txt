Hold up, wait a minute (Uh-huh, I see)
Let me put some kush up in it (Breathe with me now)
Hold up, wait a minute (I see)
Let me put some kush up in it (Breathe with me now)
Hold up, wait a minute (I see)
Let me put some kush up in it (Breathe with me now)
Hold up, wait a minute (Yeah)
Let me put some kush up in it (Yeah, yeah)

Now, this that puff, puff, pass shit, Cheech and Chong glass shit
Blunts to the head, kush pillows, no mattress
Speedboat traffic, bitches automatic
Cross that line, fuck around and get your ass kicked
We roll shit that burn slow as fucking molasses
Probably wont pass it, smoke it til the last hit
Down to the ashes, Mary J. a bad bitch
Andre, 3001, another classic (One, one, one)
Go ahead, ask em— bitches bout how I be smoking out
(Party all night) Oh, yeah, its goin down
Order rounds, we smoke a quarter pound of that good stuff
Oh yeah, we smokin all night
Yeah, puff puff pass that shit right here
Nigga, better than my last batch
Caramel complexion and her ass fat

Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale, whoa

I know you tryna get high
Type of shit that have you leanin sideways (Whoa, oh)
Take a whiff of this, suicide
Holla at me, ‘cause I got it all day (Yeah, ayy)
No need to fly to Jamaica
For the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want the bomb-bomb-diggy?
Holla at my niggy right here in L.A.
Inhale (L.A.), exhale (L.A.)
Inhale (L.A.), exhale

Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it

Hmm! Still, I am
Tighter than the pants on will.i.am
Black throwback Steeler hat, pound in my backpack
Next to where the Swishers at, smoking presidential
Got some bubba, Ill give you that, need it for my cataracts
Four hoes and Im the pimp in my Cadillac (Where my money, bitch?)
You can tell them Cali back; matter-fact, theyll know
This aint dro, get a whiff of that
No, it aint no seeds in my sack, you aint never gotta ask, dog
What he smokin on? Shit, kush til my mind gone
What you think Im on? Eyes low, Im blown
High as a motherfucker, yeah, aint no questions bout it
Niggas say, Smoke me out, yeah, I really doubt it
Im Bob Marley reincarnated, so faded
So if you want it, you know your nigga, homie
You can put it in a Zag or a blunt and get blunted

Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale, whoa (Yessir)

I know you tryna get high
Type of shit that have you leanin sideways (Whoa, oh)
Take a whiff of this, suicide
Holla at me, ‘cause I got it all day (Yeah, ayy)
No need to fly to Jamaica
For the ganja, we can get the same thing
You want the bomb-bomb-diggy?
Holla at my niggy right here in L.A.
Inhale (L.A.), exhale (L.A.)
Inhale (L.A.), exhale

Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
Inhale slow, no joke, make your ass choke
Hold up, wait a minute, you can go put it back
‘Cause what you got in your sack, boy, it aint that
Need that kush, we blow on the best smoke
Inhale slow, no joke, make your ass choke
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale
