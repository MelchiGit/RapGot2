Doc, doc, you gotta give us some good news
(Yeah, about that…)

Dont let me find out the bitch in you
Dont let me find out the snitch in you

Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, Im done with foreplay
Doctors orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin, overdose and kill yourself
Doctors orders

Listen, this is my evaluation
This shit oversaturated, yall can get evacuated
Kids sippin Actavis and they aint even activated
Married to the Internet, stuck in place, salivatin
Aint nobody graduatin
Dont nobody love this shit the way I love it
Thats why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that aint no exaggeration
Damn, Im gettin aggravated
Fuck, Im gettin agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen actin twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four actin half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin on?
These niggas in tight shit, Im in the fuckin Matrix
Its lookin like a sign of the revelation
Bout time of the return of the fuckin greatest
I got all these patients, man
How come they aint patient with me?
They just think I want the money
Why? When I cant take it with me
Yall dont do it for the love, for the love not
They gon find out who you are
Just admit it fore you get admitted

Say, what you livin about? (Fuck you gon tell me?)
Do you remember where you started out though?
Youre lookin lost now (You want a pass? Oh, damn!)
Fake it til you make it, take your little paper
But when you look in the mirror your credibility’s gone now
Id rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who Im not, thats word to Doc

Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, Im done with foreplay
Doctors orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin, overdose and kill yourself

In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off
Probly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended
See how plain it was now, they want me to jet
But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, til I took off
Mistook me because I looked soft
But I stood tall, I just followed the Doctors orders
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what Im ‘posed to do, alls
I did was say what Im feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, its almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when Im gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fuckin goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karmas headed for Armageddon
The drama setter, Im going in, already got an arm and head in
Whoever said words are just words aint heard me word em
I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch
And whatever bitches feel like they didnt deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse
Its worth it, so Doc, turn the beat on
Whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And heres to all the years I spent toein a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind
In my mind Im still underground as a groundhog
And Ima go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
No signs of slowin, these lines are my 9s
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign
Been a Doctors assault rifle
With the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, I spray (uh)
Pain in the ass, youll get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Aint no one safe from, non-believers there aint none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
Im waitin on someone to say somethin
Dre, make the bass pump!
And let the tape run for old times sake!
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment youre waitin for has come, but the—

Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, Im done with foreplay
Doctors orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin, overdose and kill yourself
Doctors orders, Doctors orders

Ah, fuck!
