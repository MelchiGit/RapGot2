Whats the difference between me and you?
Whats the difference between me and you?

Back when Cube was rollin with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
Thats fucked up, but Ill never forget the shit we been through
And Ima do whatever it takes to convince you
Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, Im still wit you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you, and thats just being real wit you
You see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is, and who Im still cool with
Then, I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin they nonviolent, talkin like they— (Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions
Move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
Until then, I aint even speakin your name
Just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
It aint that Im too big to listen to the rumors
Its just that Im too damn big to pay attention to em
Thats the difference

Whats the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you dont do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
Im used to livin big-dog-style and straight coastin
Whats the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you dont do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
Im used to livin big-dog-style and straight coastin

Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate, play with it
Never knew about the next level til Dre did it (Yeah)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash the critics like a overhand right from Riddick (Yeah)
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid—never come down!
Pass it around if you cant handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
Whats the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, Im Bangladesh
I suggest you hold your breath til aint none left
Yo, thats the difference!

Whats the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you dont do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions

Aight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute! I got somethin to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I dont know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin back (Right), just know this shit
Slim, I dont know if you noticed it
But Ive had your back from day one, nigga, lets blow this bitch
I mean it, dog—you ever need somebody offed: Whose throat is it?
Well, if you ever kill that Kim bitch, Ill show you where the ocean is
Well, thats cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughters mama
Ima sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off, honkin the horn for her (*Beep-beep!*)
Raw-dog, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
Thats for tryna talk like The Chronic was lost product
Thats for even thinkin of havin them thoughts thought up
And you better show some respect whenever the Docs brought up
So whats the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, I just dont give a fuck! and see who means it

Whats the difference between me and— (*gunshot*)
