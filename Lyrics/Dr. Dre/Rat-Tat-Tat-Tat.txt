You really dont understand, do you?
Hey man, dont you realize in order for us to make this thing work, man, weve got to get rid of the pimps, and the pushers and the prostitutes?
And then start all over again clean
Nigga, is you crazy?
Once again, the mighty Death Row organization committin mass murder
And we aint askin for shit, nigga, we takin it
So, Dre, blast they ass, nigga!

Rat-tat-tat-tat late at night with my gat
On the streets of L.A. wonderin where the pussy at
Straight player, looking for a ho
Hangin out, rollin in my six-four
Sixteen switches for the niggas in my hood
Seventeen shells so I make it understood
Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut
Ya come outside, nigga, ya gettin fucked up
I done told ya, creep-creep, ya best move
Like Luther Vandross, Im fuckin up the west coast
Im right back up in ya when ya nut
One, two, three nut, from the D-R-E but
This is for the hoes that I used to know
When I didnt have my sixty-four and a lot of dough
I keep it like this and like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Ooh-wee, thats that nigga owe you that grip

Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (Yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Creepin and peepin and we can get with these
The Chronic, slangin fat kis from my block
And it dont stop, tell me where you wanna go
To the strip, or take a trip ballin with the Row
My shit off in ya system attacks
Indo smoke go in ya lungs like that
You get lifted, calm, and if its the bomb
Taken away like Calgon, Vietnam
California, back and on a mission
Provin a point, in my game, aint no fuckin competition
They wishin but run up on reality
C-P-T, C-A-L my locality
Its strange how I re-arrange and change
The business by droppin shit like this
Dope, niggas cant cope with the real
I bill, penitentiary steel, when I kill, it goes

Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (Yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (Hell yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Straight up
Now you niggas know where my homie comin from
So quit the chit-chat fore you find yourself flat on your bizzack, fool
Its nine-deuce, Dr. Drizzays sittin on tizzop
It dont stop, treatin busters like a punk-ass cizzop
Biatch!
