These old sneakers, faded blue jeans, no tricks, no gimmicks
I be stompin down-down-down-down-down demons
Rollin up trees in the belly of the beast
Where the people disagree
The upper class eat, middle dont exist
The bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks
Are you jumpin on a fad, layin in a ditch?
I be stompin down demons, stompin down quick, come on

And please dont come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when were fuckin shit up, come on

Bullets still ringin, blood on the cement
Black folks grievin, headlines readin
Tryna pay it no mind, you just livin your life
Everyone is a witness, everyone got opinions
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I aint livin in fear, but Im holdin him tight
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I aint livin in fear, but Im holdin him tight

Damn, why the fuck are they after me? Maybe cause Im a bastard?
Or maybe cause of the way my hair grow naturally?
Still tryna figure out why the fuck Im full of rage
I think I noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade
Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switchblade
Nothin but pussy on my mind and some plans of gettin paid
But Im a product of the system, raised on government aid
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid
Just a young black man from Compton, wonderin, who could save us?
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis
Some of us was imbalanced but some us used our talents, shit
Not all of us criminals but cops be yellin, Stay back, nigga!
We need a little bit of payback (Payback!)
Dont treat me like an animal cause all this shit is flammable
Dont fuck around cause when its done, its done
Fuck you!

And the old folks tell me its been goin on since back in the day
But that dont make it okay
And them white folks tell me all the lootin and the shootins insane
But you dont know our pain

And please dont come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we fuckin shit up, come on
And please dont come around these parts
And tell me that were all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when were fuckin shit up, come on

These old sneakers, faded blue jeans, no tricks, no gimmicks
I be stomping down-down-down-down-down demons
Rollin up trees in the belly of the beast
Where the people disagree
The upper class eat, middle dont exist
The bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks
Are you jumpin on a fad, laying in a ditch?
