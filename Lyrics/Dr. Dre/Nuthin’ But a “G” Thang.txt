Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please dont try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so Ima let em understand
From a young Gs perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin her man and learnin her man
And at the same time burnin her man
Now, you know I aint with that shit, Lieutenant
Aint no pussy good enough to get burnt while Im up in it (Yeah)
And thats realer than Real-Deal Holyfield

Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

Well, Im peepin and Im creepin and Im creepin
But I damn near got caught cause my beeper kept beepin
Now its time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo
With a producer who can rap and control the micstro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but dont choke
If you do, youll have no clue
Of what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

Its like this and like that and like this and a—

Gettin funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
Its the capital S, oh, yes, Im fresh, N, double-O, P

Showin much flex when its time to wreck a mic
Pimpin hoes and clockin a grip like my name was Dolemite
Yeah, and it dont quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin G shit (Hell yeah)
So, Dre (What up, Dogg?)
Gotta give em what they want (Whats that, G?)
We gotta break em off somethin (Hell yeah)
And its gotta be bumpin (City of Compton)

Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin like a motherfucker but I aint lynchin
Droppin the funky shit thats makin the sucker niggas mumble
When Im on the mic, its like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close and your assll get smacked
My motherfuckin homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, cause if I slip, then Im slippin
But if I got my nina, then you know Im straight trippin
And Ima continue to put the rap down, put the mac down
And if you bitches talk shit, I have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you dont stop
I told ya Im just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But Im never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better
