Yeah, nigga, were still fuckin wit you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.
99, nigga, guess whos back
Still, still doin that shit, huh, Dre?
Oh for sho
Yeah
Check me out

Its still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though Ive grown a lot, cant keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that Im known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when Im on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say raps changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you aint up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, Im ahead of my game
Still puffin my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin police (Huh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho)
Still got love for the streets, reppin 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin my thang
Since I left aint too much changed, still

Im representin for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, its the D.R.E.
Im representin for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, its the D.R.E.

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
Hes triple platinum, doin 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My lifes like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke til Im sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til youre soakin in your seat
Its not a fluke, its been tried, Im the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru
Im still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D.R.E.

Im representin for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, its the D.R.E.
Im representin for them gangstas all across the world

It aint nothin but more hot shit
Another classic CD for yall to vibe with
Whether youre coolin on the corner wit your fly bitch (Biatch)
Laidback in the shack, play this track
Im representin for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin them corners in them low-lows, girl)
Ill break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you aint up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name (What?), still runnin the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still aint trippin, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin hard (Nah, nah)
Barbeques every day, drivin fancy cars (Hey, hey)
Still gon get mine regardless (Still)

Im representin for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, its the D.R.E.
Im representin for them gangstas all across the world

Right back up in your mothafuckin ass
9-5 plus four pennies, add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some wit your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Well, yous a fool, D-R, ha-ha
