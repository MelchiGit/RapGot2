The hoods you threw up with, niggas you grew up with
Dont even respect your ass
Thats why its time for the doctor to check your ass, nigga
Used to be my homie, used to be my ace
Now I wanna slap the taste out ya mouth
Make ya bow down to the Row
Fuckin me, now Im fuckin you, lil ho
Oh, dont think I forgot, let you slide
Let me ride, just another homicide
Yeah, its me so Ima talk on
Stomping on the easiest streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back cause you might get smoked, loc
And pass the bud and stay low-key
B.G., cause you lost all your homies love
Now call it what you want to
You fucked with me, now its a must that I fuck with you

You better raise up

Put down the candy and let the little boy go

Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Doggy Doggs in the motherfuckin house
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay

It seems like youre good for making jokes about your jimmy
Well, heres a jimmy joke about your mama that you might not like
I heard she was a Frisco dyke
But fuck your mama, Im talking about you and me
Toe to toe, Tim M-U-T
Your bark was loud but your bite wasnt vicious
And them rhymes you were kickin were quite bootylicious
You get with Doggy Dogg? Oh, is he crazy?
With your mama and your daddy hollering Baby!
So wont they let you know

So you wanna pop that shit, get your motherfuckin cranium cracked, nigga, step on up
Now, we aint no motherfuckin joke, so remember the name
Mighty, mighty D-R

Now understand this, my nigga Dre cant be touched
Lukes bending over so Lukes getting fucked, buster
Mustve thought I was sleazy
Or thought I was a mark cause I used to hang with Eazy
Animosity made you speak what you spoke (Yeah)
Ayo, Dre (What up?) Chip this nigga off, loc
If it aint another ho that I gots to fuck with
Gap teeth in your mouth so my dicks gots to fit
With my nuts on your tonsils
While youre on stage rappin at your wack-ass concert
And Ima snatch your ass from the backside
And show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride
Now you might not understand me
Cause Ima rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gonna creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission as I steps in the temple
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat
You tryna check my homie, you best check yourself
Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself, motherfucker (Yeah, nigga)

So I dont want no dilapidated, two-faced, pigeon-toed, bow-legged, cross-eyed son of a gun fuckin with me (Fuckin with me)
