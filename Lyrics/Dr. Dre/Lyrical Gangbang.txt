This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area

Now Ima kick up dust as I begin to bust
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers you cant trust
When I kick up, I lick up, your face get smacked up
When I rack up, so all you mothafuckas just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think youre swift with the gift, Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stockin
Im knockin em out the box and
Knockin em out their socks and cause Robin is rockin
Breakin em down to the slab
Takin em down on their ass
Now what you wanna do? Ya wanna battle? Uh
Send you up shit creek without a motherfuckin paddle
Rattle that brain, Im not the same old plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, youre nothin more than a grain
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull? Then pull it, uh
I got the trigger so I figure youll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuss
Do what I must, and what I must is bust
A bubble or two, some trouble for you
So skip to my Luger, Lady of Rage is comin through

Some cool shit
Some cool shit
Boo-ya, spittin out buckshots

I fears no one, I makes em cool off like the polar cap
Clenchin as the hits misses the rollers back
Pushin packs to make a profit
Diggy dope duck on the topic, so stop and give me my props, kid
Im livin large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, Im hard to bogart so the fact is
This young black kid a mercenary, merciless
Murderin millions of niggas, so whos first to diss?
They say Im bad, so youll find none worse than this
Chewin motherfuckers up like a Hersheys Kiss
Put to sleep, loving the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half, niggas
Youre quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass, nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, cause Im the last nigga
You wanna fuck wit, so up your cash, nigga
I make em stagger, Im scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
Im a good tracker, scopin your girl then watch me tag her
Pullin steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment, I put track on crack
And Im strapped with a semi-tone milli-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks em off, I breaks em off, chief
Deadly as Jason on Friday the 13th

A to the motherfuckin K

Back in the days, niggas, they use to scrap
But now in 92, niggas, they pull their strap
Cause, um, police, them come wicked then them shoot niggas
So niggas retaliate and start to loot
Execute, boot stompin
Black soldier here to teach and mold ya
The innovator, dominator, narrator
R-B to the motherfuckin X, flex wicked
Stylee, bump and be found and do bleed by a
Maniac with a gat
See, nowadays, niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
Buh-buh-buh, now Im on death row
Fuck it, niggas goin wild
Every night they shoot, its like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Kevlar vest for your chest
Anytime steppin through my hood
But thatll do you no good
One slug to your face, dont hate
Youre gettin smoked like wood
Nasty nigga, bloody pumps, face flat
On the concrete, here comes the white sheet
Mr. Coroner, caught with some yellow tape
But the murderers escape
Audi like five Gs
Lyrical gangbang but its just a G thang
