I dont give one fuck
Off the top I wish a nigga would try a nigga
Real shit, yall counterfeit
Yall niggas bad business
Thats why the game all fucked up
Fuck Glocks, Im all about Fort Knox, nigga
Ridin through your neighborhood
Throwin money out the window like What!?
You about the dollar (You know nothin bout it)
Your poor life been without it
My life in the spotlight
Oh no, no, no, I aint even got to talk about it, talk about it
Hol up, if you really bout it
Tell these mothafuckas we dont even wanna talk about it—what?

I dont know everything, but one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)
Is one day, Imma have everything—is one day, Imma have every thing
It was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all!)

I just bought California
Them other states aint far behind it either
I remember selling instrumentals off a beeper
Millionaire before the headphones or the speakers
I was getting money fore the internet
Still got Eminem checks I aint opened yet
M.V.P. shit—this is where the trophies at
D-R-E, yeah, this is where the dope is at
The world aint enough, I want it all
Goddammit, Im too old, I forgot I got it all
But Andre young enough to still get involved
And Andre still young enough to say fuck yall
Fuck you, fuck you, and you in the corner, too
If you wanna beef, make sure that thats somethin you wanna do
Theres some missin people that felt that way too

I dont know everything, but one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)
Is one day, Imma have everything—is one day, Imma have every thing
It was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all!)

What the fuck was yall thinking?
You let the wrong young nigga link with a legend
Lotta new niggas talking crazy on the records
Im the only king here, you can tell em that I said it
Im the black Eminem, Im the humbler 50
Im D.O.C., who do it better? Nobody fuckin with me
I murder rappers everyday, til police come and get me
And Dre just come and bail me out and then we hit the studio
Aint no new rap in my ear, too many depressed niggas
Emotional every song, deserve-to-have-breast niggas
Crying bout my old girl, funny how I left niggas
Trying to get my ex boxed, Red Ring of Death niggas
Im Kanye raising the diamond on the day of his chaining
If this was you, your diamond wouldnt be worth the appraising
Im just talking reckless, Im just off the record, but I mean it
Kept my blessings, we was dreaming, now we close enough to see it

I dont know everything, but one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)
Is one day Imma have everything—is one day, Imma have every thing
It was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all!)

Listen, Ive been tryna get it all
Im just in this bitch, Imma show em how to get involved
Yeah, I want everything (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I want everything (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Talk about it, hol up, if you really bout it
Tell these mothafuckas, we dont even wanna talk about it, what?
