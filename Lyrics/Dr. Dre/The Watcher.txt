Things just aint the same for gangstas
Times is changin, young niggas is agin
Becoming OGs in the game and changin
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rappin
When niggas get wrapped up in image and actin
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags—when it happens, thats it
Ive seen em come, Ive watched em go
Watched em rise, witnessed it, and watched em blow
Watched em all blossom and watched em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost em both
Went and visited niggas in the hospital
Its all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show (The watcher)

Cause everywhere that I go
Aint the same as befo (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just dont know me no mo (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (Im watching)

I moved out of the hood for good—you blame me?
Niggas aim, mainly, at niggas they cant be
But niggas cant hit niggas they cant see
Im out of sight now, Im out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
Youd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I aint a thug—how much 2Pac in you you got?
I aint no bitch, neither
Its either my life or your life and I aint leavin, I like breathin
Cause nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip—shit, four-pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fuckin with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you
Remember that when you wanna come and fill these shoes (The watcher)

Cause everywhere that I go
Aint the same as befo (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just dont know me no mo (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (Im watching)

Things just aint the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we was raised in
Then, they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
Cause every time you let the animal out cages
Its dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now, we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters livin amongst us
Lookin at us now, callin us busters
Cant help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfuckin thanks I get?
Its funny how time flies
Im just having fun, just watchin it fly by (The watcher)

Cause everywhere that I go
Aint the same as befo (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just dont know me no mo (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (Im watching)

The watcher
Im watching
The watcher
