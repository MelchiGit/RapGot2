Im about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im runnin out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I dont even know if I believe it when Im sayin that
Doubts startin to creep in, every day, its just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for em, they just say its wack
But they dont know what dope is
And I dont know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I dont see why you dont see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fightin you, its dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I dont think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin mic
Or you gon hug me, but Im outta options
Theres nothin else I can do cause—

Im about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im runnin out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say theyre just pieces, so Im puzzled
Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But youre either gettin lazy or you dont believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Cant make a decision, you keep questionin yourself
Second guessin and its almost like youre beggin for my help
Like Im your leader, youre supposed to fuckin be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin you
Dont sign me, everyone at the fuckin label, lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, Im cryin in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe its my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I aint givin up faith, and you aint givin up on me
Get up, Dre, Im dyin, I need you
Come back, for fucks sake, cause—

Im about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im runnin out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I dont see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fuckin wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the crackers ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin wack math, backwards producers; Im back, bastards
One more CD and then Im packin up my bags
And as Im leavin, Ill guarantee theyll scream:
Dre, dont leave us like that, man, cause—

Im about to lose my mind
Youve been gone for so long
Im runnin outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
