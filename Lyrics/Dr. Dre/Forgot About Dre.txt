Yall know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no Gs
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me ‘cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and its all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did yall think Ima let my dough freeze?
Ho, please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-Es, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C.s
The Snoop D-O-double-Gs
And the group that said, Motherfuck the police!
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales werent doin too good
Whos the Doctor they told you to go see?
Yall better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Yall are the reason that Dre aint been gettin no sleep
So fuck yall, all of yall!
If yall dont like me, blow me!
Yall are gon keep fuckin around with me and turn me back to the old me

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say
But nothin comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye (Chu lookin at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I dont give a fuck if its dark or not
Im harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When Im drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!
Ima kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin barkin dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still werent found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, its the Chronic II
Startin today and tomorrows anew
And Im still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
Theres no way that you can save me
Its okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

If it was up to me, you motherfuckersd stop
Comin up to me with your hands out
Lookin up to me like you want somethin free
When my last CD was out, you werent bumpin me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you wont get a crumb from me
‘Cause Im from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told em all
All em little gangstas, who you think helped mold em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin bout guns like I aint got none
What, you think I sold em all
‘Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off
What, ‘cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin to get this damn label off?
I aint havin that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It aint gon be nothin after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So wheres all the Mad Rappers at?
Its like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin a Cabbage Patch
