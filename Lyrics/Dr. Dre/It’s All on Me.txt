Family problems, it aint easy handling those needs
(Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do)
Baby mama drama, I just need a little time to go to sleep
(Damn, only if I had a little time for me)
Record company motherfuckers asking me when Im gonna release
(Im under pressure homie, so much pressure on me)
And my homies on my back
About me helping them get up off them streets
(I mean what the fuck?)

And it all falls back on me
(I said it all falls down)
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me
(Somehow it always fall back on me)
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, its on me
(No matter where we are its on me)
If it was up to you thats just the way its always gon be
(Listen to me)

Its kind of funny how they fall back on me
I used to never get a call back, homie
Before the money they didnt see me
Like its dark and its all black, homie
But now they switching cause the card black, homie
It wasnt always that way, we was recording on the 4-track, homie
New apartment, no fridge, no mattress, no table, no cable
And all I hear is my girl in my ear
And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back, homie
I wouldve never saw this happening from that far back, homie
What it came to be, would have never believed
Living the life I lived in C-P-T
A motherfucking dream to reality is what you call that, homie
Yeah, it was something to me
No eat, no sleep, wasnt nothing to me
Cant always be how you want it to be
And Im the one that they looking up to
Fuck they expecting from me?

And it all falls back on me
(I said it all falls down)
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me
(Somehow it always fall back on me)
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, its on me
(No matter where we are its on me)
If it was up to you thats just the way its always gon be
(Listen to me)

Thats just the way it is, and how it always was
DJing parties in my neighborhood just for the love
Dope dealers overtipping and bitches stripping
And any minute niggasll start tripping and start shooting shit
On any given day Im like what the fuck?
Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs
Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up
And now its Fuck the Police all up in the club
Now its 91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit and was like
What up cuz? Let me show you what this chronic like
Couldnt help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life
And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in
(Woo!) This one of those dreams you dont wake up from
Then again, you dont sleep if you come from where I come from
Where the sun shines and they bust nines, no 9 plus 1-1
When they run up on your school bus with a tool tucked
You might learn something

And it all falls back on me
Somehow, it all falls back on me
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, its on me
If it was up to you thats just the way its always gon be
