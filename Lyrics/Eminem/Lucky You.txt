Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I dont take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but Ill prolly never get it
I aint never had no trophy or no motherfuckin ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, Im that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
Im about to risk it all, I aint got too much to lose
Yall been eatin long enough, its my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

Yall gotta move, yall gotta move, yall gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Yall gotta move, yall gotta move, give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, its back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin
Back on my hood shit, its back to the pushin
These packs and Im actually pumpin
Cant fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin
You mighta went platinum but that dont mean nothin
Im actually buzzin this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I dont kill you, just know you gon suffer this time
I aint no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live on Mars, Im not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch Im a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
Theyve invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin for somethin I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant til nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
Ive been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, Ill tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my sonll be alright now
I said aint no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die Im goin out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin lawn mower (Vroom!)

I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get em
Wasnt in it for the trophies, just the fuckin recognition
Fucks the difference?
Im that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
Ive been eatin long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still I dont have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids it dont actually matter
Theyre askin me, What the fuck happened to hip-hop?
I said, I dont have any answers
Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but Im back on these rappers
And actually comin from humble beginnings
Im somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, What a wonderful feeling!
Were on the upswing like were punchin the ceiling!
But nothin is feeling like anyone has any fuckin ability
To even stick to a subject, its killin me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why dont we make a bunch of
Fuckin songs about nothin and mumble em?
Fuck it, Im goin for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin up
Dont give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Lets recap, way back, MCs that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADATs, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin, face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I dont hate trap, and I dont wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think its inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil bitch)
And if I pay it attention Im probly makin it bigger
But youve been takin ya dicks in the fuckin back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin of finishin
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin the benefits
Im asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin about an evil intent
Of another beat Ima kill again
Cause even if I gotta end up eatin a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well cause Ima end up bein a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me Im not a fuckin record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I roll til the wheels fall off, Im workin tirelessly, ayy
Its the moment yall been waitin for
Like California wishin rain to pour
In that drought, yall been prayin for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer mightve fell off
Im back on that bull like the cowboy

So yall gotta move (Yeah), yall gotta move (Yeah), yall gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Yall gotta move, yall gotta move, give me the juice
