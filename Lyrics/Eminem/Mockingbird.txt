Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But ayy
Whatd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When Im gone, but Im tryin to give you the life that I never had
I can see youre sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
Cause youre scared, I aint there
Daddys with you in your prayers
No more cryin, wipe them tears
Daddys here, no more nightmares
We gon pull together through it
We gon do it, Lainie—Uncles crazy, aint he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
Were all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled, in a daze, I know its confusin you
Daddys always on the move, Mommas always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy dont want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I dont see us ever bein
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but its just something
We have no control over, and thats what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day well wake up and thisll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddys here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommys not here right now, and we dont know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Mommas gon be alright (Heh)

Its funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree
And said some of em were from me cause Daddy couldnt buy em
Ill never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin
Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin money for you in a jar
Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And thats when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein Daddy on the TV, and Momma didnt like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now Im sittin in this empty house
Just reminiscin, lookin at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, its almost like youre sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddys still here
Lainie, Im talkin to you too, Daddys still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, its got a ring to it, dont it?
Sshh! Mommas only gone for the moment

Now hush, little baby, dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddys here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommys not here right now, and we dont know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Mommas gon be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird
Ima give you the world
Ima buy a diamond ring for you, Ima sing for you
Ill do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine
Ima break that birdies neck
Ill go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, dont fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)
